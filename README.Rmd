# EncircleR

The goal of EncircleR is to automate and streamline circRNA analysis, by providing a graphical interface for selecting and downloading reference files, Perform read trimming and read mapping, and finally to perform circRNA detection by exploring backsplice junction contents.

### Software
In order to use the tools provided in this guide, and to install the required dependencies, the following external software must be installed:

 * libgit2: [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/focal/libgit2) [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/libgit2), [Mac Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/libgit2)
 * gcc-fortran: [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/gfortran)  [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/gcc-fortran) [Mac installation instructions](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinariesMacOS)
 * R: [Ubuntu](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/) [Arch linux] (https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/r/) [Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/)
 * RStudio: [Ubuntu & Mac](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) [Arch linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rstudio-desktop-bin/)

## The circulaR package
EncircleR uses the `circulaR R` package for performing circRNA detection. Therefore, in order to install `EncircleR`, the `circulaR` pacakge along with its dependencies, must be installed.

### R package dependencies
The following Biocodncutor packages are dependencies of both the `circulaR` and the `EncircleR` package:

circulaR:

 * AnnotationDbi
 * BiocGenerics
 * BSgenome
 * DESeq2
 * ensembldb
 * GenomeInfoDb
 * GenomicFeatures
 * GenomicRanges
 * Gviz
 * IRanges
 * Rsamtools
 * S4Vectors

EncircleR
 * AnnotationHub
 * S4Vectors
 * plyranges
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("AnnotationDbi", "BiocGenerics", "BSgenome", "DESeq2", "ensembldb", "GenomeInfoDb", "GenomicFeatures", "GenomicRanges", "Gviz", "IRanges", "Rsamtools", "S4Vectors", "AnnotationHub", "S4Vectors", "plyranges"))
```

The `devtools` R package must be installed, to enable easy installation of `circulaR` and `EncircleR` from github.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools", dependencies = TRUE)
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/KasperThystrup/circulaR")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/KasperThystrup/EncircleR")
```

## Troubleshooting
This should install all dependencies from the official CRAN repository.
However, if something does not work out, try to install these CRAN
dependencies manually with `install.pacakges` before running the install github command again:

 * dplyr
 * ggplot2
 * parallel
 * pbmcapply
 * plyr
 * readr
 * RSQLite
 * stringi
 * tibble
 * tidyr
 * logger
 * config
 * ggplot2
 * golem
 * shinyjs
 * shiny
 * processx
 * attempt
 * DT
 * glue
 * htmltools
 * shinydashboard
 * scales
 
# Execution
To starting the graphical interface up, the following commands should be executed.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(EncircleR)
run_app()
```
